CK: Introduction to Data & SQL <br /> 
During this 8-week Kickstarter Course in Data & SQL, I learned how to build, deploy, and maintain a Database. <br /> 
For this project, I used an E-Commerce Data Set found on Kaggle and updated some datasets with additional data to create 5 separate excel tables. Then I used those tables to run some SQL queries. Finally, I leveraged those newly created base tables to export as a CSV into Tableau where I was able to create some visualizations to display my data in a dashboard.
